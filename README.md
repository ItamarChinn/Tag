# Tag - chase your dreams

## What is Tag?

- Tag is a habit tracker that creates little journeys for the user to track their periodic habit progress
- Tag is highly customizable

## Ideas to extend Tag

- Custom journey styles
- Switch between charts and JourneyDiagram (some kind of progress analytics)
- Log images with each progress and export GIF when journey is complete
