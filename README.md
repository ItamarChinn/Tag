Check the [current version of the website out here](http://tag-chaseyourdream.herokuapp.com/)

## What is Tag?

- Tag is a habit tracker that creates little journeys for the user to track their periodic habit progress
- Tag is highly customizable

## Ideas to extend Tag

- Custom journey styles
- Switch between charts and JourneyDiagram (some kind of progress analytics)
- Log images with each progress and export GIF when journey is complete

## Notes

- You will need to add a .env file with SESSION_SECRET and MONGO_SRV variables
- Tag was created as a part of Weblab in MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP) by Itamar Chinn, Sarah Edwards and Anupama Phatak in January 2021
